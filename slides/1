When developing smart contracts, there are a few toolsets you can use to ease the pain (it hurts bad) of blockchain interaction.

The toolset we are going to use today is:
- ethers (https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js#readme) for blockchain interaction
- Waffle (https://getwaffle.io/) for testing
- OpenZeppelin (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/) for high quality smart contract implementations to inherit from
- Buidler (https://buidler.dev/) as a framework to tie everything together
