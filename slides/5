OpenZeppelin does smart contract audits and has produced the most widely used smart contract libraries in the industry.

Some libraries include:
  - Token spec implementations (ERC20, ERC721, etc)
  - Function permissioning
    - On the public blockchain anyone can try to execute your smart contract's functions
  - Safe math functions
  - Proxy gas fee contracts
  - Crowdsale frameworks
