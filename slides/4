Waffle is a testing framework build on top of the JavaScript testing framework `chai`.

It provides:
 - Testing matchers to simply writing test assertions
 - Fixture loading
 - Custom compilation options
 - Mocking of smart contracts
 - Support for TypeScript



The examples that follow don't use much of Waffle's capabilities, but it is undeniably a powerful and useful tool.
