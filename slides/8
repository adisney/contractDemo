If we want to compete on high value liquidations, invoking a smart contract function on another contract is how we would do it.

- Deploy a ShotGun contract
- Fund it with either the tokens or ETH needed
- Watch for liquidation opportunities
- When found, have many different Ethereum accounts call a ShotGun.trigger() function
- ShotGun receives all the invocations and calls the `liquidate` method
- The first transaction mined after the liquidation event is the winner.
